= Project Setup

- The project setup is the same for both Hilla and Flow
- Download a starter. Current URL is https://github.com/peholmst-sandbox/unified-tutorial/releases/download/latest-starter/unified-chat-tutorial-starter.zip but it will change once we go live with the tutorial.
- Explain the structure of the starter project. What are the different directories, what do they contain, why, etc.
- Pick technology: Flow or Hilla?
  - Show this:

  - Introduce the concepts "presentation layer" and "application layer" and why it makes more sense to use them in a Vaadin application than "frontend" and "backend"
