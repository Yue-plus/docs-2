= React Router in Hilla

The file router of Hilla is built on top of https://reactrouter.com/en/main[React Router], a popular routing library for React applications. This article describes the details of the router integration, and provides instructions for customizing the route mapping.


== React Router Mapping

In cases when file-based routing is not applicable, it is possible to declare views manually in the route mapping, which is described below.

The route mapping is managed through a source file called [filename]`routes.tsx`. This file defines the application's routes, including the components associated with each.

The file defining the route mapping is located in the project's `frontend` directory. When this file is missing, a default template is generated and used in the `frontend/generated` directory. You can copy the generated file to the `frontend` directory and use it as a base for creating a custom route mapping.

Here's an example of how the route mapping looks typically in a Hilla application:

[source,tsx]
----
import { createBrowserRouter, RouteObject } from 'react-router-dom';
import { buildRoute } from "Frontend/generated/flow/Flow";

export const routes = buildRoute();

const routing = [
  {
    element: <MainLayout />,
    children: [
      { path: '/', element: <MainView />, handle: { title: 'Main' } }
      { path: '/about', element: <AboutView />, handle: { title: 'About' } }
    ],
  },
] as RouteObject[];
export const routes = buildRoute(routing, routing[0].children);

export default createBrowserRouter(routes);
----

In this example, two routes are defined: the root path `/` and the `/about` path. These routes are associated with different components. The `<MainLayout />` component acts as the layout template for the entire application. In addition, the routes from the file router, and the server-side Flow routes are combined with this mapping using the provided `buildRoute()` utility. The last line creates and exports the router instance.

The router instance is then used in the [filename]`index.tsx` file to render the application.
